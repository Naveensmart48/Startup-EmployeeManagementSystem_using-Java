Employee Management System
Project Concept
The Employee Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage employee information efficiently. This tool allows users to perform various operations such as adding, searching, editing, deleting, and displaying employee records. The application uses serialization to save and retrieve employee data, ensuring that the information persists between sessions.

Features
Add Employee: Input and store details of new employees including ID, name, salary, contact number, and email ID.
Search Employee: Retrieve and display information about a specific employee based on their ID.
Edit Employee: Update the details of an existing employee.
Delete Employee: Remove an employeeâ€™s record from the system.
Display All Employees: View a list of all employees with their details.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Serialization: For persisting employee data to a file
Data Structures: ArrayList for storing employee records
Application Logic
Data Persistence:

Loading Data: When the application starts, it checks if a serialized file exists. If so, it loads the employee records from this file.
Saving Data: On exiting the application, it saves the current state of employee records to a serialized file.
User Interaction:

The application provides a menu-driven interface allowing users to select different operations.
Depending on user input, the application performs the chosen operation and displays the results.
Error Handling:

The application handles exceptions related to file operations and data processing, ensuring smooth execution.
Functions
1.display(ArrayList<Employee> employees): Prints a formatted list of all employee records.
2.loadEmployees(): Loads employee records from the serialized file.
3.saveEmployees(ArrayList<Employee> employees): Saves the current list of employee records to the serialized file.
4. main(String[] args): Provides the main user interface for interacting with the employee management system.
